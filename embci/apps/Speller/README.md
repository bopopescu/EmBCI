# Speller
Speller is a mind-typing system that integrates a web user interface and some bio-signal analysis algorithms. It displays array of blocks on webpage. Each block is marked with an alphabet and will blink in a specific frequency. EEG signal of users will also be recorded simultaneously. By analyzing EEG data, we can find out which block user is staring at.

Users can watch the UI through computer, tablet or even mobile phone.
